        <p>Visual Hierarchy is used to rank design elements and influence in the order you want your users to view them. By using principles like contrast, scale, balance and, more, you can help establish each element in its rightful place and help the most important elements stand out. </p>
        <p>Sizing is a very basic but crucial principle that can give elements more importance than others and help draw the viewer’s eye towards a certain area. By increasing the scale of an element, you can immediately attract the viewer’s attention. You want to be careful, however, not to enlarge too many elements or increase the size in a way that might decrease the importance of other elements on the screen.</p>

        <p>Hick's law, or the Hick Hyman Law, named after British and American psychologists William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman, describes the time it takes for a person to make a decision as a result of the possible choices he or she has: increasing the number of choices will increase the decision time logarithmically.</p>

        <h2>Fitt's law</h2>

        <p>Fitts's Law is a principle in human-computer interaction and ergonomics that is particularly relevant in web development. Named after psychologist Paul Fitts, the law states that the time required to rapidly move to a target area is a function of the distance to the target and the size of the target. In the context of web development, this principle is often applied to user interface design, especially in the placement and sizing of interactive elements such as buttons and links.</p>
